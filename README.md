# Ọ̀nụ: The Vibe-Coded Disaster 🤡

Welcome to Ọ̀nụ, easily the stoopidest language you will ever use. It was entirely vibe-coded to make you type as much as humanly possible just to add two numbers. If you like productivity, leave now. This language exists so you can write code that looks like a formal apology letter.

## Why is it like this?
There is no reason. The vibes were just there. It forces you to explain your "intent" and your "concerns" before you're allowed to actually do anything. It's like a compiler that's also a middle manager.

## Syntax (The Long Way)

Everything in Ọ̀nụ is a "discourse." You don't write functions; you declare "behaviors." You don't have variables; you have "irrevocable let-bindings."

### Hello World (The "Please Sir" Edition)
```
the behavior called run
    with intent: say hello because the vibes demand it
    as:
        emit "Hello, World!"
```

### Math (Because Symbols are for Geniuses)
We don't use `+` or `-`. That's too fast. We use words.

```
the behavior called math-demo
    as:
        let a is added-to receiving 10 5
        let b is multiplied-by receiving a 2
        emit b
```

### Logic and Comparisons
```
the behavior called check-stuff
    as:
        if is-greater-than receiving 10 5
            then emit "10 is big"
            else emit "math is broken"
```

## The "Gatekeeper" Rules
The compiler is very sensitive and will stop you if you don't follow the vibes:
1. **No Duplicates:** If you write two behaviors that do the same thing (even if they have different names), the compiler will get mad because you're repeating yourself.
2. **Don't Get Deep:** If you nest your code too deep, the compiler quits. It doesn't like complexity. Keep it shallow.
3. **Say Why:** You have to declare a `with intent` or `with concern`. If you don't tell the language *why* you are doing something, it won't let you do it.

## How to use this thing
Since this is a vibe-coded masterpiece, you need Rust to run it.

1. **Build the gatekeeper:**
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

2. **Run a script:**
   ```bash
   cargo run -- your_file.onu
   ```

## Standard Library (The Word Salad)
Here are the "verbs" you can use:
- **Math:** `added-to`, `subtracted-from`, `multiplied-by`, `divided-by`
- **Logic:** `both-true`, `either-true`, `not-true`
- **Comp:** `is-equal-to`, `is-greater-than`, `is-less-than`, `is-zero`
- **Text:** `joined-with`, `len`, `char-at`, `as-text`
- **I/O:** `emit`

Enjoy your hand cramps. ✌️
